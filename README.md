# Trello Card Creator Assignment

This repository contains two distinct implementations of a Trello Card Creator: one built with Python using Flask and another with Node.js using Express.

## Overview

The Trello Card Creator is a simple web application that allows users to input specific details and, upon submission, a card is created in Trello with the provided information.

## Implementations

### Python (Flask) Version

 - This version uses Flask as its web framework and makes HTTP requests to the Trello API to create cards.

### Node.js (Express) Version

 - This version utilizes the Express framework and employs the axios package to make HTTP requests to the Trello API.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the desired version's directory (either Python_Version or NodeJS_Version).
2. Once the application is running, access the web interface via your browser, fill in the form with the desired card details, and submit.
3. A confirmation message will be displayed upon successful card creation or an error message otherwise.

## Assignment Context

This project was developed as an assignment during my internship at Cloudify. It was designed to assess my skills in API calls, backend development, and my proficiency with both Node.js and Python. Through this assignment, I've demonstrated the ability to create a similar application using two different tech stacks, showcasing adaptability and versatility in software development.
